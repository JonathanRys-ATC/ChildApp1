### Compression & Tension Stress
Compression stress is the result of axially-loaded forces pointing towards the center of an object. There are two major issues with compression stress: Compression forces can cause an object to shorten, or they can cause an object to buckle. When an object buckles, it bends in such a way that it can no longer hold the load, even though structurally speaking, the object can hold more stress than is applied to it.

Tension stress is caused when axially-loaded forces are pulling away from an object's center, and perpendicular to the object's surface. Tension stress can cause lengthening of an object. There are several materials, concrete for example, where the object can only withstand a fraction of the stress when the object is in compression.

### Shear & Bending Stress
Shear stress is caused when the forces applied to an object are parallel to the object's cross-section. This stress can cause the object to deform and, in some cases, pull apart. As the object deforms, it changes. The shape of the object can change, which can affect how the object withstands other forces.

Bending stress is seen in longitudinally-loaded objects. The forces cause the object to bend, usually in a downward direction. The farther away from the object's fixed supports, the greater the bending stress
